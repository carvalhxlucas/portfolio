## About Me

I am a Software Engineer specializing in the intersection of Cloud Architecture and Generative AI.

Beyond just writing code, I architect intelligent systems designed to solve complex real-world problems. Currently, my focus is on building scalable RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) solutions and high-performance APIs utilizing Python, Node.js, and AWS. I bridge the gap between robust software engineering and modern AI capabilities, ensuring that backend logic translates into seamless, efficient, and user-centric experiences.

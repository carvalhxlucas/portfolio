## About Me

Hi, I'm Lucas. I build robust and scalable Software Solutions.

Building on a foundation of over 7 years in Support/Infrastructure, I transitioned to Software Engineering with a clear mission: to close the gap between code and production.

What makes me different? I don't just understand the syntax; I understand the ecosystem. My hybrid background allows me to write code that is performant, secure, and ready to scale on AWS.

Currently, I am applying this mindset to AI Engineering, building production-grade RAG systems and autonomous agents.

My Philosophy: A model or feature is only valuable if it can be deployed reliably. I bridge the gap between Development and Operations, ensuring that what we build actually works in the real world.

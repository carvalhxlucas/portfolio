## About Me

I am a Software Engineer dedicated to building robust, scalable, and cloud-native solutions.

My focus goes beyond writing code; I design systems that are secure, efficient, and easy to maintain. I specialize in bridging the gap between complex backend logic and intuitive user experiences, always prioritizing architectural integrity and long-term performance.

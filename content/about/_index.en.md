## About Me

I am a Software Engineer specializing at the intersection of Generative AI and Cloud Architecture. With a strong foundation in data engineering, backend development (Python/Node.js), and AWS infrastructure, I focus on designing scalable RAG systems, orchestrating LLMs, and automating complex business workflows. I believe that true AI innovation goes beyond consuming APIs, it is about building highly reliable systems, ensuring data consistency, and elevating the software development life cycle through AI-driven approaches.

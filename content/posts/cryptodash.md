## The Challenge
Building an application to track cryptocurrency quotes and metrics in a centralized, visual way.

## The Solution
I developed a **dashboard** in **Python** that consumes cryptocurrency data and displays it in a single interface. The project includes reusable utility modules and a main application that can be extended with new data sources and visualizations.

### Engineering Highlights
* **Modular Structure:** Separation between data logic and presentation.
* **Python:** Code organized for clarity and maintainability.

### Tech Stack
* **Python**
* **Custom utilities** (`utils` package)

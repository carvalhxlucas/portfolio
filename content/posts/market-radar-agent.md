## The Challenge
Building an automated system to track market signals and deliver relevant insights without manual monitoring, combining structured data sources with LLM-based analysis.

## The Solution
I developed a **Market Radar Agent** in **Python** that monitors market-related data and uses an LLM to synthesize information and generate alerts or reports. The agent can be extended with custom data sources and reasoning logic for different use cases.

### Engineering Highlights
* **Agent-based design:** Modular architecture for pluggable data sources and actions.
* **LLM integration:** Use of language models for summarization and insight generation.
* **Automation:** Scheduled or event-driven execution for continuous monitoring.

### Tech Stack
* **Python**
* **LLM provider** (OpenAI-compatible or similar)
* **Custom utilities** for data ingestion and formatting
